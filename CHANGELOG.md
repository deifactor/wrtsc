# Changelog

All notable changes will be recorded here. This project does *not* adhere to semantic versioning (it's a game, so why should it?); major/minor versions will be based on what I feel like is a Big Update.

## [Unreleased]

## Balance

- Sensor drones now give a `1 + log2(1 + drones/4)` bonus to explore/observe, making them better early on.

## Fixes

- Tooltips are now always on top of all other parts of the UI
- "Auto-restart on failure" relabeled to "pause on failure", with the same functionality
