# wrtsc, a time-loop incremental game about robots and revenge

An incremental/idle game where you're stuck in a time loop and pick a set of actions to do in each iteration. Heavily inspired by [Idle Loops](https://lloyd-delacroix.github.io/omsi-loops/) by lloyd-delacroix, omsi6, and StopSign. Play that if you want something complete-ish with the same gameplay concepts; it's quite a fun game, and I'm on my third runthrough. Shout-out to the Discord for all the feedback.

This is still pre-alpha; there's no demo or anything available yet and the test coverage is bad. Expect `main` to be constantly broken.

## (Planned) features:

- Built-in predictor, so you can see what your resources will be like after each action in a loop. Uses the exact same logic as the game's own loop.
- Nonlinear progression; depending on what you want to do in a loop and how good your stats are, you might just skip a zone entirely.
- An actual story. Advancing through the game unlocks "cutscenes" and lore fragments.
- A "catch-up" system; every second you spend with the game closed is banked, and you can spend them to accelerate the game loop to catch up. Leave it open for 24/7 slow progress or close it when you're not paying attention for short bursts of quick progress.
- Robots! I'm tired of "evil robots attack humans" stories; what about the other way around?
